I created a Power BI dashboard using data from ESPN StatsGuru to analyze cricket playersâ€™ performance across batting, bowling, and fielding metrics. The project focuses on presenting clean, structured KPI tables without charts, using DAX functions to calculate key statistics such as batting average, strike rate, economy rate, wickets, and catches. I manually extracted and cleaned the data, built a simple data model, and delivered a clear and organized view of player performance, providing valuable statistical insights for cricket analysis.# ESPN-CRCIKET-DATA-ANALYSIS
